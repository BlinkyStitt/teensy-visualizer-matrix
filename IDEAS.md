when its falling, turn the color off and only do white? or maybe half of them

cycle color pallets

change speed

scale frequency bins to match recently heard lows and highs. that way a piano solo would still get the full rainbow

two white dots

change the side we flip to if all of them are on the same side

use sin or cos or something like that for setting the speed. only flip direction if its slow enough. otherwise, decrease speed when 

change rainbow to go left to right, red to purple
