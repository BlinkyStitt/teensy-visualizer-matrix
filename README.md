# Teensy Visualizer Matrix

Instead of a single strip of LEDs, I'm running 2 64x8 LED matrixes.

## TODO

* color blind pallete instead of hues
* add fonts
* scroll a message when battery is low
* add sprites
* scroll a sprite when it turns on
* document running Arduino IDE with verbose compilation output to get all the right flags for .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json
* i really want to split my project into multiple files, but vscode doesn't work with multiple .INO and moving to .H and .CPP is more work
